### Improve the Compatibility

* Removed empty rows on save, reducing the generated workbook file size

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a v2.10.0 regression where the `GetCellValue` and `GetRows` functions returned shared string indexes for empty strings, resolve issue [#2240](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2240)
* Fixed `GetPivotTables` panicking when retrieving pivot tables in some cases
* Fixed a panic when reading cell values with certain number format codes containing Chinese month names, resolve issue [#2224](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2224)

* Fixed `SetConditionalFormat` generating corrupted workbooks when setting time period conditional formatting rules
* Fixed `CalcCellValue` failing to resolve references in some cases by trimming single quotes from sheet names
* Fixed `NewStyle` creating duplicate styles when using the default font or fill, resolve issue [#2254](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2254)

### Performance

* Optimized `CalcCellValue` by adding a calculation cache and limiting processing to actual data ranges, resolve issues [#2057](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2057) and [#2223](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2223)
* Optimized `CalcCellValue` formula evaluation for `VLOOKUP`, reducing memory usage and execution time by about 50%, resolve issue [#2139](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2139)
* Optimized `GetMergeCells` by speeding up overlap checks for merged cell ranges and reducing memory usage, resolve issue [#2226](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/issues/2226)
* Optimized applying number format codes by converting using continued-fraction recurrence formulas
