* Make `SetCellStyle` quicker by skipping conversions in `checkCellInArea`, and skipping area checks when we are sure the cell can't be before or past the current row/col
* Save bytes on memory instead of string, 11% memory savings, see [Performance Figures](https://github.com/xuri/excelize/wiki#performance-figures)
